00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.099
<v Mullins, Nicky>So I think the discussion at the

00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:19.035
<v Mullins, Nicky>the discussion at the moment. So
I think 7 that's why the test</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1816-1

00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:06.814
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>I think there's there's, there's
probably.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1834-0
00:13:08.084 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Three or four streams of work
that are happening with various</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1834-1
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.964
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>right now, I think the first one
is.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1863-0
00:13:14.364 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>You're running a bunch of stuff
for us. Just keep make sure.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1863-1
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.456
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Keep making sure that runs and
it doesn't fall over. And you</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1863-2
00:13:20.456 --> 00:13:22.404
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>know, we get we get good KPIs
because.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1886-0
00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:28.878
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Everything that we're doing must
support our an existing</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1886-1
00:13:28.878 --> 00:13:31.777
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>business. That's one. The second
is kind of that blueprint too is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1886-2
00:13:31.777 --> 00:13:33.534
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>that it's a major, major piece
of work.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-0
00:13:35.094 --> 00:13:38.862
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>The third is and there's a bunch
of kind of. I'd say I'd put them</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-1
00:13:38.862 --> 00:13:42.345
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>in the BAU upgrade category. So
sequel underwriting upgrade,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-2
00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:45.885
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>that kind of thing, that's what
aims upgrade and that kind of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-3
00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:49.425
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>thing. And the last one is that
more strategic stuff, so that</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-4
00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:52.565
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>that sequel underwriting
upgrade, all of those kind of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1935-5
00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.934
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>things and where we where we
take the product longer term.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-0
00:13:56.484 --> 00:14:00.089
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>And that's maybe somewhere where
we work with the likes of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-1
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.512
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>yourselves and and Simon and
your product team to think</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-2
00:14:03.512 --> 00:14:06.995
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>about, well, actually let's
let's assume that we can get</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-3
00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>these upgrades for claims and
underwriting and we can work</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-4
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.633
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>through Blueprint too. Where are
the core products going? How are</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-5
00:14:14.633 --> 00:14:18.300
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>we going to interface those to
our to our underwriting work</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1976-0
00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:15.464
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-6
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.905
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>wrenches to our core data marks,
all of that kind of stuff</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-7
00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:25.877
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>because otherwise we get caught
up in the day-to-day fixing this</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/1996-0
00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:22.604
<v Gillett, Andrew>Mm hmm.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2005-8
00:14:25.877 --> 00:14:26.244
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>thing.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2031-0
00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.771
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>The single most important thing
of all of those is we have to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2009-0
00:14:27.634 --> 00:14:28.274
<v Gillett, Andrew>Absolutely.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2031-1
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:32.063
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>keep the existing systems
running and up and and secure</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2031-2
00:14:32.063 --> 00:14:34.601
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>and reliable. But I think that
that's kind of almost a given,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2031-3
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:36.074
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>but we still need to focus on
that.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2046-0
00:14:36.774 --> 00:14:39.992
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah, now understood. And and it
was, yeah, it was that. That's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2046-1
00:14:39.992 --> 00:14:42.054
<v Gillett, Andrew>the very reason for asking the
question.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2060-0
00:14:43.694 --> 00:14:48.476
<v Gillett, Andrew>When, when? When. Rob discussed
and Nikki discussed this with me</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2060-1
00:14:48.476 --> 00:14:50.094
<v Gillett, Andrew>a couple of weeks ago.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2087-0
00:14:52.574 --> 00:14:56.867
<v Gillett, Andrew>The we you're very much looking
for much more of a focus on</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2087-1
00:14:56.867 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Gillett, Andrew>product strategy etcetera. So
hence you know the reason for</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2087-2
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.595
<v Gillett, Andrew>the for the question bringing
along obviously happy to anyway</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2087-3
00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:06.454
<v Gillett, Andrew>bring along.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-0
00:15:07.104 --> 00:15:11.320
<v Gillett, Andrew>Roman and you know they the
product owner level. I'm just</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-1
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.827
<v Gillett, Andrew>thinking potentially bringing
somebody like Ash, Cotton who's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-2
00:15:15.827 --> 00:15:20.334
<v Gillett, Andrew>head of product and has much
more holistic view across across</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-3
00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:24.768
<v Gillett, Andrew>the various products that than
the individual product owners</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-4
00:15:24.768 --> 00:15:29.275
<v Gillett, Andrew>for say SQL underwriting or or
or claims or anything else. So</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-5
00:15:29.275 --> 00:15:34.000
<v Gillett, Andrew>but we can play that one by ear
and just for now, I'll I'll work</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2148-6
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.544
<v Gillett, Andrew>with Tristan just to get this
the.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2155-0
00:15:37.584 --> 00:15:40.784
<v Gillett, Andrew>Meetings into the diary really.
As soon as we can.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2191-0
00:15:41.404 --> 00:15:44.875
<v Gillett, Andrew>And we'll make sure we have for
that well for each meeting,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2191-1
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:48.287
<v Gillett, Andrew>certainly for that first one,
we'll work together and make</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2191-2
00:15:48.287 --> 00:15:51.411
<v Gillett, Andrew>sure we've got a fairly
comprehensive deck to kind of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2191-3
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:54.997
<v Gillett, Andrew>catch up on everything. So so
we've got that complete view of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2182-0
00:15:52.594 --> 00:15:52.914
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2191-4

00:15:58.274 --> 00:16:01.858
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>I think what we also need to
consider is as as we progress</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2207-1
00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:04.834
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>through this, we're going to
have more and more.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2257-0

<v Mudhar, Arvinder>we've got separate kind of
components and systems that sit</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2257-3

<v Mudhar, Arvinder>see it as a single connected
piece rather than we've got</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2257-5
00:16:24.908 --> 00:16:27.834

00:16:28.294 --> 00:16:31.081
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>That's down to the fact that you
know, various have grown by</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2277-1
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:34.005
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>acquiring these, but we want it,
we we want to see the value of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2277-2

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2303-2
00:16:45.598 --> 00:16:48.814
<v Gillett, Andrew>some time for that kind of
discussion during the.</v>

<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah, OK. Alright.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2440-1
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:40.140
<v Gillett, Andrew>probably everybody else here has
spent their life in insurance. I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2440-2
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.488

<v Mudhar, Arvinder>OK.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2440-3

00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:52.654
<v Gillett, Andrew>You know, hedge funds and
investment banks and so on. So</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2468-1
00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.504
<v Gillett, Andrew>it was actually it's been an

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2468-2
00:17:55.504 --> 00:17:58.404
<v Gillett, Andrew>moving into insurance because
everybody's 10 times nicer.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2460-0
00:17:55.914 --> 00:17:56.194
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2479-0
00:18:01.494 --> 00:18:02.254
<v Swift, Christopher>Ha ha ha.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2501-0
00:18:05.664 --> 00:18:08.104
<v Mullins, Nicky>No, I know I've been there. I've
been there myself. No, true.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2540-1
00:18:05.896 --> 00:18:10.464
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah, it's AI wish it wasn't.
But sorry, I've I've only, I'd</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2502-0
00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:08.764
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah. OK.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2540-2
00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:15.406
<v Gillett, Andrew>say only I've been in working on
the insurance side now for about</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2540-3
00:18:15.406 --> 00:18:20.048
<v Gillett, Andrew>6-7 eight years. But I yeah, I
don't have the extreme history</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2528-0
00:18:18.654 --> 00:18:19.054
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>OK.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2540-4
00:18:20.048 --> 00:18:22.744
<v Gillett, Andrew>of most of you have been
insurance.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2541-0
00:18:25.824 --> 00:18:26.024
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2561-0
00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:32.081
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>So moving on to the task list,
so I'll call out the important</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2561-1
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:36.684
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>items. So sequel claims upgrade,
the SRW is fully executed.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2594-0
00:18:37.894 --> 00:18:43.621
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>We had two paths when we last
met. A fast path for our 2024</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2594-1
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:49.347
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>November and a happy path in mid
Q1. So we are leaning more</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2594-2
00:18:49.347 --> 00:18:54.883
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>towards the happy paths and the
fast path is looking more</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2594-3
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.174
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>unlikely as we progress.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2624-0
00:18:59.134 --> 00:19:03.542
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>The timelines we are discussing,
we are yet to narrow it down and</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2624-1
00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:07.816
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>produce a solid plan, but with
the team, Nikki, we have already</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2624-2
00:19:07.816 --> 00:19:11.489
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>discussed the plan which we
currently have where it is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2624-3
00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:14.094
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>leading into. We are planning to
drop.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-0
00:19:15.474 --> 00:19:20.272
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Uat, one on this side of the
Christmas and UAT two in January</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-1
00:19:20.272 --> 00:19:25.147
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>and further proceed to go live
in February. These numbers need</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-2
00:19:25.147 --> 00:19:29.171
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>to be validated by the
engineering team and that is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-3
00:19:29.171 --> 00:19:33.891
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>planned in the following month
and we'll keep you updated on</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-4
00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:38.457
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>that. Then we'll be able to
publish a solid plan and track</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2670-5
00:19:38.457 --> 00:19:40.314
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>along with that as well.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2681-0
00:19:42.184 --> 00:19:44.824
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>On the commercial, yeah, yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2673-0
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:42.584
<v Swift, Christopher>So.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2701-0
00:19:42.274 --> 00:19:46.358
<v Mullins, Nicky>They're just just sorry, just a
apologies last week when we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2701-1
00:19:46.358 --> 00:19:50.646
<v Mullins, Nicky>spoken to the deep dive we were
talking about fast path, which</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2701-2
00:19:50.646 --> 00:19:54.594
<v Mullins, Nicky>was a pre Christmas go live and
that was being driven by.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2734-0
00:19:54.634 --> 00:19:58.121
<v Mullins, Nicky>David and people above to to
deliver sequel claims ahead of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2734-1
00:19:58.121 --> 00:20:01.201
<v Mullins, Nicky>Christmas, so they were
targeting October, November.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2734-2
00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Mullins, Nicky>Since then we've had discussions
about this happy path which is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2734-3
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.954
<v Mullins, Nicky>more a lower risk, higher
quality.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2751-0
00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:11.283
<v Mullins, Nicky>You know more reliability of a
delivery and so that's what we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2751-1
00:20:11.283 --> 00:20:13.314
<v Mullins, Nicky>talk fast and happy. So fast was
November.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2787-0
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:16.831
<v Mullins, Nicky>Which we're saying now is is
high risk, very unlikely to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2787-1
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:20.394
<v Mullins, Nicky>deliver. So now we're looking at
what would be the happy path and</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2787-2
00:20:20.394 --> 00:20:23.579
<v Mullins, Nicky>where would that land us and
hence my questions that start</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2777-0
00:20:21.724 --> 00:20:21.924
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2787-3
00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:25.954
<v Mullins, Nicky>that would push us into Q1 we're
currently.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2789-0
00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:29.754
<v Mullins, Nicky>The.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2801-0
00:20:29.774 --> 00:20:31.745
<v Mullins, Nicky>The PAS upgrade is already
sitting there and obviously</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2801-1
00:20:31.745 --> 00:20:32.534
<v Mullins, Nicky>blueprint too as well.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2802-0
00:20:32.854 --> 00:20:33.094
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yep.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-0
00:20:34.044 --> 00:20:36.956
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>So we can talk about this. I
should like it's Chris's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-1
00:20:36.956 --> 00:20:40.245
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>business. So you've got to be
comfortable that it comes at a</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-2
00:20:40.245 --> 00:20:43.695
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>point where in terms of business
volumes, you can manage it and</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-3
00:20:43.695 --> 00:20:47.254
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>but also in terms of risk at the
point of delivery, you're you're</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-4
00:20:47.254 --> 00:20:50.381
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>comfortable with it. So we need
to work through that with</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2842-5
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:51.244
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>yourself, Chris.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2844-0
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:52.964
<v Swift, Christopher>Yeah, exactly.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2855-0
00:20:54.444 --> 00:20:57.029
<v Swift, Christopher>For us in the claims team,
obviously 'cause it's an</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2855-1
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.924
<v Swift, Christopher>upgrade, it's not.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-0
00:21:00.064 --> 00:21:03.166
<v Swift, Christopher>It's not gonna affect us by
doing it later if if need be,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-1
00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:06.535
<v Swift, Christopher>but it does affect obviously the
reserving team and that's why</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-2
00:21:06.535 --> 00:21:09.904
<v Swift, Christopher>David and everyone like Richard
was pushing for it. So I think</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-3
00:21:09.904 --> 00:21:13.273
<v Swift, Christopher>obviously it'd be interesting.
It'd be interesting to get that</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-4
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.748
<v Swift, Christopher>information as soon as possible
because that communication needs</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2898-0
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:16.684
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-5
00:21:16.748 --> 00:21:19.904
<v Swift, Christopher>to go out to all the people
that's going to be impacted by</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2904-6
00:21:19.904 --> 00:21:20.064
<v Swift, Christopher>it.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2933-0
00:21:20.104 --> 00:21:23.598
<v Swift, Christopher>But from a closure perspective,
yeah, I think from operationally</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2933-1
00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:27.092
<v Swift, Christopher>we'll have somebody to test and
business as well. So we'll be in</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2933-2
00:21:27.092 --> 00:21:30.424
<v Swift, Christopher>a position at whatever point to
be able to do that, I reckon.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2935-0
00:21:34.124 --> 00:21:34.964
<v Mullins, Nicky>Well, thanks Chris.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2937-0
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:39.914
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-0
00:21:42.374 --> 00:21:46.661
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>K So Nikki a follow up question
which you had answers more</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-1
00:21:46.661 --> 00:21:50.948
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>towards the commercial and is
coming discussed with Simon,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-2
00:21:50.948 --> 00:21:54.872
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>what we have given you is
something more like a fixed</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-3
00:21:54.872 --> 00:21:59.522
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>price and we will try to honour
it to the best possible extent.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-4
00:21:59.522 --> 00:22:03.664
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Of course I can't give a
commitment that will definitely</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/2988-5
00:22:03.664 --> 00:22:06.934
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>stick there, but if it is within
reasonable.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3022-0
00:22:08.654 --> 00:22:12.046
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Ask of the project. We will
stick with that. I'll get a much</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3022-1
00:22:12.046 --> 00:22:15.549
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>more better narration from Simon
once he's back from holidays.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3022-2
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:18.885
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>I'll be able to commit on that
as well. And once we get the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3022-3
00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:22.054
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>project plan in place, I think
these both will coincide.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3052-0
00:22:23.984 --> 00:22:29.477
<v Mullins, Nicky>And and that was the the fixed
price for the movement to 7.2</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3052-1
00:22:29.477 --> 00:22:34.791
<v Mullins, Nicky>and OK, that was it. So it's
coming and that's taking into</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3052-2
00:22:34.791 --> 00:22:40.104
<v Mullins, Nicky>account the six days effort that
Chris has been reviewing.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-0
00:22:40.634 --> 00:22:45.145
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yes. So that is something which
we need to work with. Chris and</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-1
00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:49.586
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>David and Chris are aligned. I
believe they want a very stable</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-2
00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:54.167
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>claims product to be configured
and production lied not go about</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-3
00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:58.678
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>the rabbit hole of enabling all
the features and going into the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-4
00:22:58.678 --> 00:23:02.837
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>configuration. But that's going
to become a TNM engagement</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-5
00:23:02.837 --> 00:23:07.277
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>completely. So that is something
as we get more details, we'll</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3110-6
00:23:07.277 --> 00:23:09.674
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>work with Chris and nail it
down.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3118-0
00:23:10.714 --> 00:23:13.754
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Few of the things which was not
part of the fast part, Chris.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-0
00:23:14.084 --> 00:23:17.932
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>For this year, the changes which
was there, our team is looking</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-1
00:23:17.932 --> 00:23:21.780
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>at it, what will be implemented,
what will be part of the scope</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-2
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.567
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>and so on. We'll get progressive
updates on that. Chris. Yeah,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-3
00:23:25.567 --> 00:23:29.295
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>'cause, that'll be good. 'cause.
Obviously we are going to be</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-4
00:23:29.295 --> 00:23:33.143
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>waiting till January, then then
extra items that we'd suggested</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3156-5
00:23:33.143 --> 00:23:33.684
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>would be.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3172-0
00:23:35.044 --> 00:23:38.230
<v Swift, Christopher>Very welcomed and obviously we
would have the time to be able</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3172-1
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.364
<v Swift, Christopher>to do that and it was scope for
as well, wasn't it? So yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3200-0
00:23:44.544 --> 00:23:49.021
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>So we'll keep you updated. Pavan
is the project manager on that,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3200-1
00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:53.360
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>so he will be sending regular
updates. One CS this engineering</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3200-2
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.562
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>deep dive completed. I think
we'll get start getting regular</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3200-3
00:23:57.562 --> 00:23:58.664
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>updates on that.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3205-0
00:24:00.364 --> 00:24:02.484
<v Swift, Christopher>We still likely to get the plan
next week.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3227-0
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:06.193
<v Swift, Christopher>'Cause, obviously that was
pushed back, wasn't it? And I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3227-1
00:24:06.193 --> 00:24:09.093
<v Swift, Christopher>think that's what we're kind of
hoping for and to be able to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3227-2
00:24:09.093 --> 00:24:10.804
<v Swift, Christopher>give that communication out
really.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3254-0
00:24:11.184 --> 00:24:15.184
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>We had the review of 1 planned
right Chris last week we can</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3231-0
00:24:11.464 --> 00:24:11.784
<v Mullins, Nicky>Absol.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3254-1
00:24:15.184 --> 00:24:19.051
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>share that, but until the
engineering team actually looks</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3254-2
00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:21.984
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>into it and validates all the
final points.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3270-0
00:24:23.444 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>The concrete numbers will have
to wait till August to get it. I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3270-1
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.011
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>will check with Pavan and ask
him to send you a note on that,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3270-2
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:30.324
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Chris.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3306-0
00:24:30.914 --> 00:24:34.408
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah, I think that we maybe we
won't get you to this list, but</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3306-1
00:24:34.408 --> 00:24:37.846
<v Mullins, Nicky>there's some themes coming up
around this kind of waiting for</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3306-2
00:24:37.846 --> 00:24:40.897
<v Mullins, Nicky>perfection and we we just need
to get a bit more agile</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3306-3
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:42.394
<v Mullins, Nicky>authorities the phrase but.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-0
00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:47.394
<v Mullins, Nicky>Are we are comfortable to
receive a draught plan earlier</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-1
00:24:47.394 --> 00:24:50.155
<v Mullins, Nicky>rather than an 100% plan late?
And I think that what I'm</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-2
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.205
<v Mullins, Nicky>hearing at the moment there's
two weeks elapsing every time we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-3
00:24:53.205 --> 00:24:56.305
<v Mullins, Nicky>go through a planning iteration
with with you guys. So you know</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-4
00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:59.501
<v Mullins, Nicky>our commitment to you is give us
a draught plan. We will treat it</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-5
00:24:59.501 --> 00:25:02.503
<v Mullins, Nicky>as draught. We're not going to
kind of hold you down to that,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3360-6
00:25:02.503 --> 00:25:04.634
<v Mullins, Nicky>but I'd rather see some
iterative planning.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-0
00:25:05.184 --> 00:25:08.322
<v Mullins, Nicky>Coming back and forth, back and
forth and then we can take it,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-1
00:25:08.322 --> 00:25:11.062
<v Mullins, Nicky>run away and come back and and
finalise those internal</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-2
00:25:11.062 --> 00:25:14.150
<v Mullins, Nicky>discrepancies. At the moment,
this kind of lag in planning is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-3
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.338
<v Mullins, Nicky>really causing challenges for us
and we're seeing it in claims.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-4
00:25:17.338 --> 00:25:20.626
<v Mullins, Nicky>We're seeing it in powers. We're
seeing other areas. So if we can</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-5
00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:23.565
<v Mullins, Nicky>commit to you in some way that
gives a draught and we will</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-6
00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:26.703
<v Mullins, Nicky>treat it as a draught, please do
encourage the team to show it</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3405-0
00:25:24.974 --> 00:25:25.254
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-7
00:25:26.703 --> 00:25:29.791
<v Mullins, Nicky>100% late. Is is really, really
difficult and it always feels</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-8
00:25:29.791 --> 00:25:32.979
<v Mullins, Nicky>that the clock stops for various
like the focus jumps across to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-9
00:25:32.979 --> 00:25:35.968
<v Mullins, Nicky>to IQ. And that really isn't
isn't the spirit of what we're</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3435-10
00:25:35.968 --> 00:25:37.064
<v Mullins, Nicky>trying to do together.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3459-0
00:25:38.144 --> 00:25:41.479
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah, I think Pavan was planning
to send it across. So let me</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3459-1
00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:44.707
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>check with them because Mark
also requested that along with</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3459-2
00:25:44.707 --> 00:25:47.504
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Chris, so I'll make sure that
you receive the plan.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3455-0
00:25:45.534 --> 00:25:46.014
<v Mullins, Nicky>We did.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3461-0
00:25:48.054 --> 00:25:48.774
<v Mullins, Nicky>Thank you.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3463-0
00:25:49.094 --> 00:25:49.654
<v Swift, Christopher>Thank you.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3465-0
00:25:52.014 --> 00:25:52.694
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>So.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-0
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:58.021
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Jumping on to the reporting
queries, Chris, there has been</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-1
00:25:58.021 --> 00:26:02.391
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>sow which was there earlier, but
now we had not request received</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-2
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:06.694
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>any updates on the extension or
a new SLA in place. So the team</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-3
00:26:06.694 --> 00:26:10.929
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>has been released. So if any new

00:26:14.627 --> 00:26:18.930
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>such request via Ian Welford and

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-6
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.166
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>routed through the support desk
so that we can work out how it</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3532-7
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:24.174
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>can be handled.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3541-0
00:26:25.504 --> 00:26:27.184

<v Swift, Christopher>No problem. Thank you.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3563-0
00:26:27.014 --> 00:26:30.170
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yep. So just your your point
there about claims support</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3563-1
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.609
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>budget has been exhausted. If we
want more work, do we do we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3563-2
00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:36.934
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>effectively need to kind of work
out how we pay for it or?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3570-0
00:26:37.094 --> 00:26:39.254
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Is is it that you don't have any
more people left?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-0
00:26:40.054 --> 00:26:43.715
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>No, no, no. The people have been
assigned to different work</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-1
00:26:43.715 --> 00:26:47.437
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>arvinder the IQ had a dedicated
team of people for a certain</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-2
00:26:47.437 --> 00:26:51.037
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>capacity each month. Now that's
exhausted. So now it'll be</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-3
00:26:51.037 --> 00:26:54.943
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>routed via the support and based
on the request, people will be</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-4
00:26:54.943 --> 00:26:58.726
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>identified and made to work on
that. And based on the ASK, we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-5
00:26:58.726 --> 00:27:02.204
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>will discuss whether it is
chargeable and how much it is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3634-6
00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:02.814
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>and so on.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3659-0
00:27:04.544 --> 00:27:08.229
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>OK. And it almost sounds like
for the next period, we need to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3639-0
00:27:05.404 --> 00:27:06.044
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>We, we.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3645-0
00:27:07.804 --> 00:27:08.084
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3659-1
00:27:08.229 --> 00:27:11.736
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>just maybe look at how much we
put aside if if we were all</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3659-2
00:27:11.736 --> 00:27:12.984
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>exhausted it already.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3698-0
00:27:14.354 --> 00:27:19.119
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yes, we need to work out that
team is aware of that. So we had</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3698-1
00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:23.203
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>budget for claims and
underwriting, I believe, Chris.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3698-2
00:27:23.203 --> 00:27:27.892
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>So that's both been the days
it's been elapsed. So if we want</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3698-3
00:27:27.892 --> 00:27:32.657
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>we can get in that request as
well arvinder. But even with the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3698-4
00:27:32.657 --> 00:27:35.834
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>support you can get chargeable
work done.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3717-0
00:27:36.864 --> 00:27:39.871
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>So SRW is not the only thing
waiting it, but the advantage</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3717-1
00:27:39.871 --> 00:27:43.184
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>with this will be you'll have a
dedicated team available to you.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-0
00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:47.478
<v Swift, Christopher>And this was all just from a
reporting perspective, wasn't</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3725-0
00:27:46.454 --> 00:27:46.614
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3732-0
00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:47.414
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-1
00:27:47.478 --> 00:27:50.575
<v Swift, Christopher>it? Not for like our claim
support because we get obviously</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-2
00:27:50.575 --> 00:27:53.722
<v Swift, Christopher>an hour every month where we sit
with our support team to go</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-3
00:27:53.722 --> 00:27:56.921
<v Swift, Christopher>through outstanding tickets.
This is more for what Ian Wealth</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-4
00:27:56.921 --> 00:27:59.914
<v Swift, Christopher>has been working on the data
lake and understanding where</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3769-5
00:27:59.914 --> 00:28:01.514
<v Swift, Christopher>tables and things like that so.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3779-0
00:28:02.034 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah, this is more of a Hadoop
things which might come up,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3779-1
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.034
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3785-0
00:28:11.244 --> 00:28:12.404
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>You're OK with that, arvinder?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3787-0
00:28:12.914 --> 00:28:13.554
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>It was.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3845-0
00:28:14.064 --> 00:28:19.236
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah, thank you. So just a brief
update on sequel underwriting</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3845-1
00:28:19.236 --> 00:28:24.408
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>RC1 and RC2 drops have been done
as per the plan and I checked</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3845-2
00:28:24.408 --> 00:28:29.416
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>internally and reconfirmed that
RC3 and RC4 are tracking are</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3845-3
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:34.506
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>tracking to plan. There are no
delays expected in this and we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3845-4
00:28:34.506 --> 00:28:39.104
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>are still aiming the Q1 call
live for SQL underwriting.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3873-0
00:28:43.294 --> 00:28:46.936
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>OK, I think there's going back
to the planning piece. So SQL</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3873-1
00:28:46.936 --> 00:28:50.579
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>underwriting going up, going
live at the same time as claims</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3873-2
00:28:50.579 --> 00:28:54.460
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>all this kind of stuff. We just
need to meet it, be very careful</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3873-3
00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.654
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>about that schedule.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3875-0
00:28:56.014 --> 00:28:56.254
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3878-0
00:28:56.304 --> 00:28:56.744
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yes.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3907-0
00:28:56.444 --> 00:28:59.732
<v Gillett, Andrew>Wait, wait. Yeah, we we need to.
We need to discuss this</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3907-1
00:28:59.732 --> 00:29:03.250
<v Gillett, Andrew>specifically. Our recommendation
obviously would be you know</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3907-2
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.884
<v Gillett, Andrew>under no circumstances do we try
and go live at the same time.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3919-0
00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:12.029
<v Gillett, Andrew>With sequel claims and their
sequel and writing V3 upgrade,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3919-1
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:13.284
<v Gillett, Andrew>it's too much change.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3923-0
00:29:14.804 --> 00:29:15.484
<v Gillett, Andrew>Far too much overlap.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3945-0
00:29:17.284 --> 00:29:21.649
<v Gillett, Andrew>And you know, very high risk if
we took that approach. So my</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3945-1
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:26.373
<v Gillett, Andrew>recommendation is is I think you
your preferences to go live with</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3945-2
00:29:26.373 --> 00:29:27.804
<v Gillett, Andrew>sequel claims first.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3956-0
00:29:28.304 --> 00:29:31.412
<v Gillett, Andrew>That makes absolutely makes
sense for the sequel</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3956-1
00:29:31.412 --> 00:29:32.744
<v Gillett, Andrew>underwriting project.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3988-0
00:29:34.184 --> 00:29:38.295
<v Gillett, Andrew>You know, my recommendation will
be we go live with sequel</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3988-1
00:29:38.295 --> 00:29:42.126
<v Gillett, Andrew>claims. I think Pavan was
talking around about a 17th,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3988-2
00:29:42.126 --> 00:29:46.376
<v Gillett, Andrew>18th of February date and then
we get through the Hyper care</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3988-3
00:29:46.376 --> 00:29:46.864
<v Gillett, Andrew>period.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/3997-0
00:29:48.584 --> 00:29:53.304
<v Gillett, Andrew>Plus a couple of weeks and then
we would look to go live with.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4005-0
00:29:54.984 --> 00:29:57.624
<v Gillett, Andrew>Segal and writing a minimum of a
month later.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-0
00:30:00.874 --> 00:30:04.577
<v Gillett, Andrew>Obviously steering well clear of
the month end, so you know</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-1
00:30:04.577 --> 00:30:08.465
<v Gillett, Andrew>potentially that would be a you
know, a 17th of March. But but</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-2
00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:12.291
<v Gillett, Andrew>again we haven't discussed any
of this and and you know maybe</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4028-0
00:30:11.734 --> 00:30:11.934
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-3
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:16.241
<v Gillett, Andrew>actually for safety's sake you
might want to say actually let's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-4
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:20.005
<v Gillett, Andrew>wait until April because we've
got quarter end and so on you</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4045-0
00:30:17.704 --> 00:30:18.184
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah. So.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4053-0
00:30:19.124 --> 00:30:20.484
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Finish the quarter end, yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4052-5
00:30:20.005 --> 00:30:20.314
<v Gillett, Andrew>know.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4076-0
00:30:20.704 --> 00:30:25.410
<v Mullins, Nicky>The high level the conversation
I had with Rob before he went on</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4076-1
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:30.115
<v Mullins, Nicky>leave was February, claims April
pass and then July indicatively</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4069-0
00:30:28.574 --> 00:30:28.654
<v Gillett, Andrew>Mm.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4076-2
00:30:30.115 --> 00:30:30.984
<v Mullins, Nicky>Blueprint 2.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4083-0
00:30:31.924 --> 00:30:35.684
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah, I'd, I'd say that's that's

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4087-0
00:30:37.204 --> 00:30:38.964
<v Gillett, Andrew>I I I definitely agree with
that.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4095-0
00:30:40.024 --> 00:30:41.664
<v Mullins, Nicky>But that, that, that.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4104-0
00:30:40.444 --> 00:30:43.404
<v Gillett, Andrew>March is March is pushing it.
You know, that's why I was.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4143-0
00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:46.156
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yeah, but but that that's me
clunkly putting 3 three things</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4109-0
00:30:45.454 --> 00:30:45.694
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4143-1
00:30:46.156 --> 00:30:50.002
<v Mullins, Nicky>in an order. What we now need
from you and the team is what?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4143-2
00:30:50.002 --> 00:30:53.658
<v Mullins, Nicky>Where's the kind of dependencies
and logic and lead times</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4137-0
00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.464
<v Gillett, Andrew>Absolutely. Yep. Yep, Yep.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4143-3
00:30:53.658 --> 00:30:57.567
<v Mullins, Nicky>etcetera that that justify me
kind of putting three things in</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4143-4
00:30:57.567 --> 00:30:58.134
<v Mullins, Nicky>an order.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-0
00:30:57.574 --> 00:31:01.064
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah. And and there are some
clear dependencies we've talked</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4147-0
00:30:58.214 --> 00:30:58.294
<v Mullins, Nicky>So.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-1
00:31:01.064 --> 00:31:04.210
<v Gillett, Andrew>about doing end to end testing
on the SQL underwriting</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-2
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.700
<v Gillett, Andrew>programme and that's full end to
end that's that's Workbench</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-3
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.018
<v Gillett, Andrew>sequel and writing Eclipse
claims and impact. And clearly</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-4
00:31:11.018 --> 00:31:14.565
<v Gillett, Andrew>we don't want to do that on a
version of claims and then have</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-5
00:31:14.565 --> 00:31:18.169
<v Gillett, Andrew>to do it again a few weeks later
on a later version of claims.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4190-0
00:31:17.634 --> 00:31:17.874
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-6
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:21.887
<v Gillett, Andrew>So. So again timing on that and
I think the timing works it, but</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-7
00:31:21.887 --> 00:31:25.034
<v Gillett, Andrew>it again it's one of those
dependencies you talk about</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4213-8
00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:27.894
<v Gillett, Andrew>Nikki that we need to we need to
clearly map out.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4212-0
00:31:26.904 --> 00:31:27.344
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4225-0
00:31:28.544 --> 00:31:32.855
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>And I think the the other thing
for for us, I think this is more</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4225-1
00:31:32.855 --> 00:31:33.584
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>fun in the.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-0
00:31:34.564 --> 00:31:36.976
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>The various products aren't the
only things within our</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-1
00:31:36.976 --> 00:31:39.432
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>environment that are going
through major upgrades. So I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-2
00:31:39.432 --> 00:31:42.151
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>think we're going to have to
build all that stuff in as well.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-3
00:31:42.151 --> 00:31:44.695
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>So it's quite a congested
sequence in quarter one already</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-4
00:31:44.695 --> 00:31:47.414
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>already going into quarter two.
So we've got a bunch of stuff</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4258-0
00:31:46.834 --> 00:31:47.154
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-5
00:31:47.414 --> 00:31:49.957
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>happening within Workbench and
and Q and all this kind of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-6
00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:52.325
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>stuff. So that's that's
something we'll have to think</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4274-7
00:31:52.325 --> 00:31:52.764

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4277-0

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4440-1
00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:10.471

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4441-0
00:33:14.584 --> 00:33:17.144
<v Mullins, Nicky>That was nice. That was nice.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4443-0
00:33:14.914 --> 00:33:15.794
<v Swift, Christopher>It's kind of it's kind of it.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4455-0
00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:20.644

<v Mullins, Nicky>So that was that again. Yes, I
am Alice's replacement, but</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4508-1
00:33:24.632 --> 00:33:27.709
<v Mullins, Nicky>Alice's role is is changing as
well, so that's why I think we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4508-2
00:33:27.709 --> 00:33:30.885

00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:08.554
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>aware where we are. There is
project plan which needs to be</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4710-2
00:35:08.554 --> 00:35:12.111
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>published and tracked. That is
something we need to take care</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4710-3
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:12.914
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>of as a whole.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-0
00:35:14.234 --> 00:35:18.440
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>But we have good understanding
of where the project is leading,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-1
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.186
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>where we are, what is the
expectations, demand pipeline.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-2
00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:26.261
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Both of us have visibility on
what we are tracking. So that's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-3
00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:30.467
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>also partially in Green, beyond
sequel Underwriting, Version 3,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-4
00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:34.542
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Blueprint 2 and claims those are
things are not yet discussed</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4759-5
00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:38.354
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>because these are really big
items which we are tracking.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4783-0
00:35:38.794 --> 00:35:42.727
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>And some comfortness needs to be
established before we move on to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4783-1
00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:46.541
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>the future. Visibility in this
though Rob and Simon are looking</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4783-2
00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:49.998
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>towards whitespace straight
through processing. There's a</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4783-3
00:35:49.998 --> 00:35:50.594
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>different.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4789-0
00:35:52.034 --> 00:35:53.634
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Topic which has been discussed
with them.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4817-0
00:35:55.484 --> 00:35:58.748
<v Mullins, Nicky>Yes, but the other one that
kinda strikes me is the green</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4817-1
00:35:58.748 --> 00:36:01.731
<v Mullins, Nicky>for overall rag for live
projects. I think without a</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4817-2
00:36:01.731 --> 00:36:05.164
<v Mullins, Nicky>holistic plan without I'd say
that's Amber. I don't. I'm not</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4817-3
00:36:05.164 --> 00:36:06.684
<v Mullins, Nicky>sure it could be green now.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4816-0
00:36:05.514 --> 00:36:05.954
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4821-0
00:36:08.304 --> 00:36:09.504
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>OK, I'll update that.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4868-0
00:36:11.014 --> 00:36:14.871
<v Gillett, Andrew>Yeah, I think I think for me
that 12 to 20 more four month</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4868-1
00:36:14.871 --> 00:36:18.466
<v Gillett, Andrew>visibility under demand
pipeline. So basically you see</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4868-2
00:36:18.466 --> 00:36:22.649
<v Gillett, Andrew>saying exactly the same thing.
So I'd agree, I think we need to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/4843-0
00:36:19.774 --> 00:36:19.894

00:36:45.258 --> 00:36:48.141

00:40:17.384 --> 00:40:21.577

<v Poovannan, Rajendran>the others.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5569-0
00:41:36.054 --> 00:41:40.154
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Your services would have been

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5569-1
00:41:40.154 --> 00:41:42.534
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>that right? Somewhere on that
time.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-0
00:41:44.104 --> 00:41:47.490
<v Swift, Christopher>Yeah. Yeah, they were up back up
and running. But yeah, we still</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-1
00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.250
<v Swift, Christopher>couldn't agree claims or
anything I saw. I think the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-2
00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.428
<v Swift, Christopher>communication was out to us
that, you know, all services are</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-3
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:56.709
<v Swift, Christopher>back up and running. But I know
right back isn't your service,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-4
00:41:56.709 --> 00:42:00.043
<v Swift, Christopher>but that still prevented us from
being able to action on on the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5614-5
00:42:00.043 --> 00:42:03.064
<v Swift, Christopher>system. So we were still
actioning outside of SQL claims.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5622-0
00:42:04.014 --> 00:42:06.894
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Yeah. And I think that that's a
good point, Chris. So there's a.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5654-0
00:42:08.094 --> 00:42:11.341
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>There's a difference between
it's all up and running to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5654-1
00:42:11.341 --> 00:42:14.819
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>actually can we use it? And I
think what we got around 2:00</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5654-2
00:42:14.819 --> 00:42:18.298
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>o'clock was it's all up and
running. So I think it, we just</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5642-0
00:42:16.724 --> 00:42:17.204
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>OK.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5654-3
00:42:18.298 --> 00:42:21.893
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>need to be I think well you need
to be clear in the future if</v>

00:42:21.893 --> 00:42:23.574

00:42:23.614 --> 00:42:27.025
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>That just because the server's
up when the application's up,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5681-1
00:42:27.025 --> 00:42:30.436
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>what business service is running
that because we it in a day</v>

00:42:30.436 --> 00:42:33.455
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>where there was mass confusion
that that added to the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5681-3
00:42:33.455 --> 00:42:34.014
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>confusion.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5683-0
00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:36.494

<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Arvinder, how do you think we
can specifically improve one is</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5695-1
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.534
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>the communications, but.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5711-0
00:42:43.874 --> 00:42:47.699
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Where the interim updates on the
outage, all those things,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5711-1
00:42:47.699 --> 00:42:51.394
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>anything from your view which
the risk could improve on.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5751-0
00:42:52.334 --> 00:42:55.912
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>I think you you almost need to
create a template of. Here's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5751-1
00:42:55.912 --> 00:42:59.550
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>all. Here's all the cert by by
clients. If you treat us as a</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5751-2
00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.306
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>client, here's all. Here's their
the five or ten services. And</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5739-0
00:43:00.304 --> 00:43:00.544
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5751-3
00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:05.334
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>then here, here are the
business.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-0
00:43:06.324 --> 00:43:09.698
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>Functions those services support
now some of that may be asked,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-1
00:43:09.698 --> 00:43:12.598
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>and that may be you and it
almost create a rag against</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-2
00:43:12.598 --> 00:43:15.551
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>those. So have that ready in
your back pocket next time</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-3
00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:18.556
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>something happens which might be
newer infrastructure or</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-4
00:43:18.556 --> 00:43:21.667
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>infrastructure wherever it is
you put it up and say here's</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-5
00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:24.461
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>where we are. Here's the
timeline. I think that that</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-6
00:43:24.461 --> 00:43:27.466
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>would really help because I
think some of some of it was</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-7
00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:30.735
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>going to Chris, some of it was
going to someone else. We just</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5809-8
00:43:30.735 --> 00:43:32.844
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>needed a kind of a a single view
of of.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5813-0
00:43:34.564 --> 00:43:35.724
<v Mudhar, Arvinder>What we could and couldn't do.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5850-0
00:43:37.074 --> 00:43:41.040
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Understood. Point taken. Yeah.
That clear dashboard kind of</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5850-1
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.138
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>template showing the different
services and business function</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5850-2
00:43:45.138 --> 00:43:49.435
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>would help, but I thought people
had been part of a distribution</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5850-3
00:43:49.435 --> 00:43:53.797
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>list. They all received the same
communication. Isn't that right,</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5850-4
00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.194
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Chris?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-0
00:43:54.604 --> 00:43:57.841
<v Swift, Christopher>I think it was going to an apps
team in it which I don't know</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-1
00:43:57.841 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Swift, Christopher>when when that was set up or by
who. But yeah, that that would</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-2
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.419
<v Swift, Christopher>obviously need to be changed.
But now I presume that because I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-3
00:44:04.419 --> 00:44:07.655
<v Swift, Christopher>was getting multiple updates
following the communication with</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-4
00:44:07.655 --> 00:44:11.049
<v Swift, Christopher>you later on, so I presume I've
now been added to that list. But</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-5
00:44:11.049 --> 00:44:14.024
<v Swift, Christopher>suppose we just need to verify
that really who's on that</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5901-0
00:44:13.174 --> 00:44:13.734
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>OK.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5903-6
00:44:14.024 --> 00:44:14.964
<v Swift, Christopher>distribution list?</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5924-0
00:44:16.154 --> 00:44:19.704
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>OK, so is the best person for
this will be Tristan to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5924-1
00:44:19.704 --> 00:44:23.451
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>coordinate to check the
distribution list and the people</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5924-2
00:44:23.451 --> 00:44:24.634
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>who is part of it.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5964-0
00:44:26.854 --> 00:44:30.905
<v Swift, Christopher>I suppose, yeah. If you want to
send it, send it through to us.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5964-1
00:44:30.905 --> 00:44:35.082
<v Swift, Christopher>In this call. You know when when
Rob's back as well, obviously we</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5964-2
00:44:35.082 --> 00:44:39.259
<v Swift, Christopher>amongst ourselves, we will be, I
suppose the key key stakeholders</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5964-3
00:44:39.259 --> 00:44:42.614
<v Swift, Christopher>that will deliver that message
back to the business.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5988-0
00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:47.255
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Will do, definitely. I added a
rob in the last minute and he</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5988-1
00:44:47.255 --> 00:44:50.854
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>said he's not receiving it over
ruling the distribution list.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5988-2
00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:54.395
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Yeah, we need to get this sorted
out when things are normal.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5988-3
00:44:54.395 --> 00:44:55.034
<v Poovannan, Rajendran>Understood.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/5989-0

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6016-2

<v Mullins, Nicky>Actually I just I will just do

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-1
00:45:48.169 --> 00:45:51.297
<v Mullins, Nicky>awareness because I think it's
it's it's appropriate for this</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-2
00:45:51.297 --> 00:45:54.323
<v Mullins, Nicky>level rather than the project
level working groups. But for</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-3
00:45:54.323 --> 00:45:57.653

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-5
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.706
<v Mullins, Nicky>already and you would have seen
some new faces start to to</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-6
00:46:03.706 --> 00:46:06.683
<v Mullins, Nicky>attend the calls. So Tristan
will be leaving us during the</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-7
00:46:06.683 --> 00:46:09.508
<v Mullins, Nicky>next couple of months. So we are
currently recruiting a</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6140-8
00:46:09.508 --> 00:46:12.837
<v Mullins, Nicky>replacement in terms of a sequel
product manager, Mark Sandy will</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6170-1
00:46:18.745 --> 00:46:21.297
<v Mullins, Nicky>a product management structure.
And I think this will work</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6170-2
00:46:21.297 --> 00:46:24.064

<v Mullins, Nicky>Gig has started to attend.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6219-0
00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:41.093

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.374
<v Mullins, Nicky>but there will be overlapping.
We're not aiming to have any gap</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6243-2
00:46:54.374 --> 00:46:56.614
<v Mullins, Nicky>between between leaders of those
projects.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6245-0

<v Mullins, Nicky>But let let's do one. Let's do
one in terms of roles. First, I</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-1
00:47:49.923 --> 00:47:52.806

00:47:52.806 --> 00:47:55.457
<v Mullins, Nicky>the people in some of them, but

00:47:55.457 --> 00:47:58.247
<v Mullins, Nicky>strategic move for us. When I

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-4
00:47:58.247 --> 00:48:00.804
<v Mullins, Nicky>management to product
management. But actually I think</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-5
00:48:00.804 --> 00:48:03.641
<v Mullins, Nicky>that means that for Verisk, you
will have better continuity.</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-6
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:06.477
<v Mullins, Nicky>Everything will come through a
single pipeline at the moment</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-7
00:48:06.477 --> 00:48:09.360
<v Mullins, Nicky>with the project management,
everyone's competing for airtime</v>

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.871

00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:14.475
<v Mullins, Nicky>halves of the business and
they're both competing. So I</v>

00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:17.265
<v Mullins, Nicky>think this will actually give
better transparency all round</v>

7abd7722-1d45-4bd0-8011-3f9377bf1f30/6466-11
00:48:17.265 --> 00:48:18.474
